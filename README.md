# NBA Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

This repository contains an in-depth exploration of NBA (National Basketball Association) data from the 2018-2019 season, showcasing Exploratory Data Analysis techniques using R and RMarkdown.

## Overview

The project aims to demonstrate proficiency in EDA methodologies by examining various facets of NBA data, including data cleaning, outlier detection, handling missing values, correlation analysis, and descriptive statistics. Through this analysis, valuable insights into player performance, team statistics, and salary distribution are derived.

## Datasets Used

- **Salaries Data:** 2018-19 NBA player salaries.
- **Payroll:** 2019-20 NBA team payroll data.
- **Player Statistics:** Detailed statistics of NBA players from the 2018-19 season.
- **Team Statistics 1 & 2:** Team statistics datasets for the 2018-19 NBA season, providing comprehensive insights into team performances.

## Key Highlights

- **Data Cleaning:** Comprehensive data cleaning processes to ensure data quality and consistency.
- **Outlier Detection:** Identification and handling of outliers within the datasets.
- **Handling Missing Values:** Strategies and methodologies used to address missing data points.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Exploring relationships and correlations between various NBA metrics.
- **Descriptive Statistics:** Summarizing and visualizing key statistical measures for a better understanding of the data.
